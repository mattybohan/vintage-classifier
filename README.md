# Dress Code

* Classify a vintage dress by decade
* Find similar items on Etsy

1. Project Overview

    The initial objective of Dress Code was to see if style–specifically
    vintage–could be featurized using computer vision techniques, allowing for
    classifying vintage dresses by decade: 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s,
    or 1990s. This is the sort of classification someone knowledgeable of fashion
    might make while picking items ("popping tags") at a thrift shop. A pretrained
    Convolution Neural Network was employed to featurize the images collected
    from Etsy while traditional models classified the feature vectors.

    The resulting model was successful in classification, obtaining a maximum
    of 87% accuracy in the binary case and 53% with all five classes. With the
    success of featurizing style with the CNN, a recommender was developed to
    that returns dresses that are similar in shape, pattern, and color–the
    visual features the model is capable of recognizing.  

    A web application was developed that allows users to:

    * Classify an image of a vintage dress by decade
    * See recommendation of similar dresses found on Etsy
